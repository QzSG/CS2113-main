== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to backup/restore user data*
** What it does: allows the user to backup current user data both online and locally. Backups can be restored by using the restore command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may have the app on many desktops and this provides a convenient way to synchronise them among many devices.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables a generic class that can be easily extended by developers to support more types of online backup services in future. It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as the backing up of data online may take a long time, existing implementation will cause the application to freeze until any backup is completed.
The current implementation exhibits a working knowledge of multithreading applications, concurrency as well as event driven programming.
** Credits: GitHub Api by kohsuke.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a user preferences command that allows the user to customise their application preferences such as default backup locations, online backup data location and other application settings.
