== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to backup/restore user data*
** What it does: allows the user to backup current user data both online and locally. Backups can be restored by using the restore command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may have the app on many desktops and this provides a convenient way to synchronise them among many devices.
** Highlights: This enhancement enables a generic class that can be easily extended by developers to support more types of online backup services in future. It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as the backing up of data online may take a long time, existing implementation will cause the application to freeze until any backup is completed. The current implementation exhibits a working knowledge of multithreading applications as well as event based asynchronous callbacks.
** Credits: GitHub Api by kohsuke.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a user prefences command that allows the user to customise their application preferences such as default backup locations, online backup data location and other application settings.

*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (Github Api by kohsuke) to the project (https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api)
*** Integrated a new Github App (Travis.com) to the team repo
**** This is different from other teams still using the old deprecated OAuth Flow used on the older Travis.org domain
